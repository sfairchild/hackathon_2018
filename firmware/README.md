# Firmware

**TODO: Add description**

## Targets

Nerves applications produce images for hardware targets based on the
`MIX_TARGET` environment variable. If `MIX_TARGET` is unset, `mix` builds an
image that runs on the host (e.g., your laptop). This is useful for executing
logic tests, running utilities, and debugging. Other targets are represented by
a short name like `rpi3` that maps to a Nerves system image for that platform.
All of this logic is in the generated `mix.exs` and may be customized. For more
information about targets see:

https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html#content

## Getting Started

To start your Nerves app:
  * `export MIX_TARGET=my_target` or prefix every command with
    `MIX_TARGET=my_target`. For example, `MIX_TARGET=rpi3`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create firmware with `mix firmware`
  * Burn to an SD card with `mix firmware.burn`

Your Nerves project was created successfully.

You should now pick a target. See https://hexdocs.pm/nerves/targets.html#content
for supported targets. If your target is on the list, set `MIX_TARGET`
to its tag name:

For example, for the Raspberry Pi 3 you can either
  $ export MIX_TARGET=rpi3
Or prefix `mix` commands like the following:
  $ MIX_TARGET=rpi3 mix firmware

If you will be using a custom system, update the `mix.exs`
dependencies to point to desired system's package.

Now download the dependencies and build a firmware archive:
  $ cd firmware
  $ mix deps.get
  $ mix firmware

If your target boots up using an SDCard (like the Raspberry Pi 3),
then insert an SDCard into a reader on your computer and run:
  $ mix firmware.burn

Plug the SDCard into the target and power it up. See target documentation
above for more information and other targets.
